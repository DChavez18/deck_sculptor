# DeckSculptor — Claude Code Context

## What this is
A Magic: The Gathering Commander deck builder app built with Rails 8.
Named after Jace, the Mind Sculptor.

## Core principles
- TDD always — write tests first with RSpec, never skip them
- Keep code simple and readable — no clever one-liners, no over-engineering
- Small focused methods that do one thing
- Descriptive naming over comments
- One feature branch per phase, PR into main, CI must be green before merging

## Tech stack
- Rails 8, PostgreSQL, Tailwind CSS, Hotwire (Turbo + Stimulus)
- RSpec, FactoryBot, Faker, Shoulda Matchers
- HTTParty for external API calls
- Solid Cache / Solid Queue (Rails 8 defaults, no Redis needed in dev)

## Free MTG APIs we use
- Scryfall API (primary) — card data, images, search. No key required.
- EDHREC — popularity and commander data
- Commander Spellbook — combo lookup
- MTGJson — bulk card data for local seeding

## Branch strategy
- main is protected — CI must pass before merging
- One branch per phase: phase-1-setup, phase-2-scryfall, etc.
- Commit messages follow: "Phase N: short description"

## Current status
- Phase 1 complete and merged — models, migrations, RSpec setup
- Phase 2 complete and merged — ScryfallService, WebMock, CardCache
- Phase 3 complete and merged — UI, controllers, views, CardCategorizer, Stimulus
- Phase 4 complete — SuggestionEngine, EdhrecService, ComboFinderService, README
- 135 examples, 0 failures
- CI green on all 4 checks

## What was built in Phase 2
- app/services/scryfall_service.rb — search_commander, find_commander,
  search_cards, find_card_by_id, cards_by_color_identity, commander_suggestions
- spec/services/scryfall_service_spec.rb — 24 examples, all WebMock stubbed
- CardCache.fetch_by_name — ILIKE partial match added to model
- WebMock added to test group

## What was built in Phase 3
- config/routes.rb — full route set
- CardCategorizer service — categorizes cards by type_line
- CommandersController — search (Turbo Frame), show
- DecksController — index, new, create, show, suggestions, analysis
- DeckCardsController — create with auto-categorization, destroy
- Views — dark blue Tailwind theme throughout
- commander_search_controller.js — debounced Turbo Frame search

## What was built in Phase 4
- SuggestionEngine — scores cards by keyword synergy, curve gap, category fill
- EdhrecService — fetches EDHREC commander data, caches in CardCache
- ComboFinderService — queries Commander Spellbook for combo detection
- Updated suggestions view — score badges, reason tags, Add to Deck button
- Updated analysis view — combos section with Spellbook links
- Updated show view — progress bar, color pips, quick stats
- README.md — full project documentation

## Models overview
- Commander — Scryfall card data for the chosen commander
- Deck — belongs to commander, holds 99 DeckCards
- DeckCard — a card in a deck with category, cmc, color_identity (string)
- CardCache — local Scryfall response cache, 7-day TTL

## Upcoming phases
- Phase 5: Strategy analysis — archetype detection, color gap analysis
- Phase 6: Commander profile — full EDHREC integration, combo synergy
- Phase 7: Deployment to Railway

## Current task
Starting Phase 5 — strategy analysis and archetype detection.
